					<p>"HyperFox is Marty McFly introducing rock at the school dance in Back to the Future. Only there’s three of them...a force to be reckoned with - experimental, energetic and entertaining. I look forward to seeing them again and hearing what other concoctions they can come up with!"</p>

					<h5><a target="_blank" href="http://www.b-sidemusic.co.uk/post/167482751365/live-review-project-mork-the-bad-apples-cuck">LIVE REVIEW: HYPERFOX @ THE OWL SANCTUARY, NORWICH (B-Side Music Magazine)</a></h5>
					<p>"New on the scene, Hyperfox kick things off with a strong set of melodic hardcore-meets-early 90s alt rock. And it is good, very good. For the most part, this reminds me a little of a more urgent – if less experimental - Girls Against Boys. There is a danger that this could veer into seen-it-all-before territory but drummer Luke’s human beatboxing and vocalist/guitarist Oli’s synth noises take things in an interesting and original direction. Hell, ‘Vader’ even manages to sound like Johnny Violent’s Ultraviolence hardcore/gabba crossover covered by Buzzcocks. Together with bassist Max, the trio make a big, anthemic noise and will surely only get better."</p>

					<h5>ALBUM REVIEW: RGNEWMUSIC</a></h5>
					<p>"We really enjoyed the album, there are some great ideas where the driving bass lines mesh with samples/electro. Loved the opening track, signposts what's to follow. Some of the samples work better than others - enjoyed Vader, Elmo almost nails it, there's even some beatbox on Take Me Out Alive. Vocals are Billy Talent-esque and the guitar riff on End of the World is a bit early U2, overall a great debut."</p>

					<p>"HyperFox impressed me, a new name but one I’ll keep an eye out for in the future, they were interesting and powerful. I enjoyed it a lot."</p>
